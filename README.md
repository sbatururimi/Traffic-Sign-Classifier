# Traffic sign classifier
Classify Traffic signs using a Convolutional Neural Network (a slightly modified LeNet architecture). 
We will train a model to classify traffic signs from the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). 

What is interesting here is that the training data are initially insufficient and we augment the whole database using different technics.
For more details check the source [code](https://github.com/sbatururimi/Traffic-Sign-Classifier/blob/master/Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb)

To create an Anaconda environment on Ubuntu, run the following command in the terminal from the root folder of the project:
```
 conda env create -f environment_ubuntu.yaml
 ```

 **Note**
On MacOs use environment_macos.yaml.
